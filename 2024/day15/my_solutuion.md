## Part 2: Python Data Types

Python has built-in data types that are used to store different kinds of values.
Below are the commonly used Python data types with examples.

---

### Integer (int)
Used to store whole numbers.

```python
age = 22
count = 10
```

### Float
Used to store decimal numbers.

```python
price = 99.75
percentage = 85.5
```


### String (str)
Used to store text values. Strings are written inside single or double quotes.

```python
name = "Python"
message = "Learning Python data types"
```


### List
Used to store multiple values in a single variable.

- Ordered
- Mutable

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)
```


### Tuple
Similar to a list, but values cannot be changed.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(numbers)
```


### Set
Used to store unique values.

- No duplicate values
- Unordered

```python
colors = {"red", "blue", "green"}
print(colors)
```


### Dictionary
Used to store data in key-value pairs.

```python
student = {
    "name": "Tushar",
    "age": 22,
    "course": "Python"
}
print(student)
```


### Boolean
Used to represent True or False values.

```python
is_active = True
is_logged_in = False
```


### None
Used when no value is assigned to a variable.

```python
result = None
print(result)
```
